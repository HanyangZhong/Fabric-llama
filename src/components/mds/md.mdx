[**Diffusion models**](https://lilianweng.github.io/posts/2021-07-11-diffusion-models/) are a class of generative models in machine learning that have gained significant attention in recent years. 

**Text-to-image diffusion models** have various application scenarios, including:

- **Art & Design**: Used by artists for creative art and fashion designers to generate clothing renderings.
- **Advertising & Marketing**: Helps in creating advertising posters and product promotion maps.
- **Game & Film**: Applied in game scene and character design, as well as film and television concept design...

> Thegeneral training steps of diffusion models are as follows:

1. Data collection
2. Noise addition
3. Model building
4. Training
5. Evaluation
6. Deployment

Lift ($$L$$) can be determined by Lift Coefficient ($$C_L$$) like the following
equation.

$$
L = \frac{1}{2} \rho v^2 S C_L
$$
